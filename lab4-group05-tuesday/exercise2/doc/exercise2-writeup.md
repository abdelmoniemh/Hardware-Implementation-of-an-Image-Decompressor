We began with the experiment 4 source code that incremented through the memory writing and checking each location once. We were able to implement the first session by starting at memory location h'1FFFF and decrementing the address by one at every operation. While verifying the values BIST_expected_data becomes address+2 instead of -2 since the read initialized 2 cycles ago was at an address higher by 2. Similarly to experiment 3 this check was valid until S_DELAY_4 where we now had to compare with address+1. This first session will have handled all of the address from h'1FFFF to h'0, after this is done (S_DELAY_4) we reset the address to h'1FFFF+1, set newly introduced signal BIST_increment to 1(BIST_increment controls the direction we traverse through the memory with) and return to the idle state to prepare for a write cycle. This second write cycle will write from h'1FFFF+1 to h'3FFFF increasing the memory address by one after every operation. BIST_expected_data is the address-2 and is valid all the way until S_DELAY_4 again where it is compared to address-1. When BIST_increment is one S_DELAY_4 does not return to idle but the test ends.
